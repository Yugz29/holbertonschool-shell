# 🐚 Holberton School Shell Project

Welcome to this repository dedicated to the Holberton School shell projects! 🎓🐚

This repo contains a collection of shell scripts designed to master basic shell commands, file manipulation, text processing, and exploring system files. Each script corresponds to an exercise or practical project aimed at developing your understanding of fundamental Unix shell concepts.

## 📂 Repository Contents

- A large number of `.sh` scripts covering classic commands:  
  - Text output, file and directory management, permissions  
  - Searching and filtering system files (`/etc/passwd`, `/etc/hosts`, etc.)  
  - Stream and text manipulation (grep, cut, tr, rev...)  
  - File cleanup and deletion (e.g., removing `.js` files)  
  - Various exercises to understand pipelines and redirections  

- Several folders and additional files may be added over time as the training progresses.

## 📚 Table of Contents

A complete list of scripts is available in the root folder, with descriptive names reflecting their purpose (for example, `0-hello_world`, `1-confused_smiley`, `6-third_line`, `21-reverse`, etc.).

Each file is an individual and independent exercise helping you learn a specific command or concept.
